== Welcome to Paypal/ruby

This library is here to aid with integrating Paypal payments into ruby on rails 
applications or similar. To set this up you will need to log into your paypal 
business account and tell paypal where to send the IPN ( Instant payment notifications ). 

== Download

* Preferred method of installation is using rubygems. gem install --source http://dist.leetsoft.com paypal
* Alternatively you can get the library packaged at http://dist.leetsoft.com/pkg/

== Requirements

* Valid paypal business account. 
* The money library from http://dist.leetsoft.com/api/money

== Installation 

1) Either install the rubygem for this library ( rake install from source 
   or gem install --source <url> paypal    using gems directly )
   
2) Create a new controller which handels the paypal related tasks.  
    script/generate controller payment   
    
3) Add the Paypal::Helpers to the newly created controller.
    module PaymentHelper
      include Paypal::Helpers
    end
4) Create a paypal_ipn ( or similar ) action like the one in the "Example rails controller" appendix. 

Within the new payment controller you can now create pages from which users can be sent to paypal. You always 
have to sent users to paypal using a HTTP Post so a standard link won't work (well OK but you need some javascript for that). The +Paypal::Helper+ namespace has some examples of how such a forward page may look. 

== Testing the integration

Under https://developer.paypal.com/ you can signup for a paypal developer account.
This allows you to set up "sandboxed" accounts which work and act like real accounts 
with the difference that no money is exchanged. Its a good idea to sign up for a 
sandbox account to use while the application is running in development mode. 


== Example rails controller

    class BackendController < ApplicationController

      # Simplification, please write better code then this...
      def paypal_ipn
       notify = Paypal::Notification.new(request.raw_post)

       if notify.acknowledge 
         order = Order.find(notify.item_id)
         order.success = (notify.complete? and order.total == notify.amount) ? 'success' : 'failure'
         order.save
       end

       render :nothing => true
      end
    end

== Example paypal forward page

   <%= paypal_form_tag %>
     <%= paypal_setup "Item 500", Money.us_dollar(50000), "bob@bigbusiness.com", :notify_url => url_for(:path_only => false, :action => 'paypal_ipn') %>  

     Please press here to pay $500US using paypal. <br/>
     <%= submit_tag "Go to paypal >>" %>

   <% end_form_tag %> 

== Changelog

2005-07-22 -- 0.9.1
* support for cancel_url as well as notify_url. This means you can now set the IPN callback address from the paypal_setup method and 
  you don't have to do that in the paypal admin interface!
* Removed the actual form tag from the paypal_setup generated code to conform better with docs
