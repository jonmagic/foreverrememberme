    <h3>Step 2: Adding Memorial</h3>
    <p>Start by entering in the first and last name of the deceased.</p>
    <p>Then you can use an obituary or any other appropriate message in the message area. Often you can call the paper that ran the obituary and they will e-mail you the original text. Then you can just copy and paste the text into the message area.</p>
    <p>Next you can put in their hometown, either where they were born or where they spent the majority of their life.</p>
    <p>Enter the date they were born, and then the date they passed away.</p>
    <p>Finally we can create our Memorial. Later we will add pictures, but for now just click the Create button.</p>
